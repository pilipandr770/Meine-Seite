# Additional Fixes for Render.com Deployment

## 1. Fixed Missing Template Variable
- Added the `now` variable to the project detail template context
- Resolved error: `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'now' is not defined`

## 2. Fixed Category Image Route
- Added URL prefix `/category_media` to the blueprint in `media_routes.py`
- This ensures URLs like `/category_media/category-image/1` are correctly routed

## 3. Minor Fixes
- Fixed inconsistency between URL patterns and blueprint registration
- Ensured proper URL path handling for database-stored images

These fixes should resolve the 404 errors seen in the logs when accessing category images.

## Next Steps for Complete Solution:
1. Run database migrations on the production server to ensure all needed columns exist
2. Test image upload and retrieval in the admin interface
3. Consider adding compression for large image uploads (the current example was 1.7MB)
