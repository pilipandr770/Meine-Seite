# Category Image Storage Fixes

## 1. Fixed Blueprint Naming Conflict

- Changed the blueprint name from 'media' to 'category_media' to avoid conflicts
- Updated route paths from `/media/category-image/{id}` to `/category_media/category-image/{id}`
- Fixed URL references in all relevant files

## 2. Updated Database Schema

- Added necessary columns to the Category model for storing images in the database:
  - `image_data` (BYTEA type for storing binary image content)
  - `image_content_type` (VARCHAR for storing MIME type)
  - `image_filename` (VARCHAR for storing original filename)
- Modified the migration script to use proper PostgreSQL data types

## 3. Testing

The test script confirms that all fields are now properly accessible in the database. The website should now be able to:

1. Upload category images and store them directly in the database
2. Retrieve and display category images from the database
3. Maintain image persistence even when the filesystem is ephemeral (as on Render.com's free tier)

## Deployment

When deploying these changes to Render.com:

1. Ensure the database schema is properly updated
2. Monitor the application logs for any remaining errors
3. Test the category image upload and display functionality

The fix has been applied successfully in the local development environment.
