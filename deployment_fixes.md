# Category Image Storage Fixes

## 1. Fixed Blueprint Naming Conflict

- Changed the blueprint name from 'media' to 'category_media' to avoid conflicts
- Updated route paths from `/media/category-image/{id}` to `/category_media/category-image/{id}`
- Fixed URL references in all relevant files

## 2. Updated Database Schema

- Added necessary columns to the Category model for storing images in the database:
  - `image_data` (BYTEA type for storing binary image content)
  - `image_content_type` (VARCHAR for storing MIME type)
  - `image_filename` (VARCHAR for storing original filename)
- Modified the migration script to use proper PostgreSQL data types

## 3. Testing

The test script confirms that all fields are now properly accessible in the database. The website should now be able to:

1. Upload category images and store them directly in the database
2. Retrieve and display category images from the database
3. Maintain image persistence even when the filesystem is ephemeral (as on Render.com's free tier)

## 4. Deployment

When deploying these changes to Render.com:

1. Ensure the database schema is properly updated
2. Monitor the application logs for any remaining errors
3. Test the category image upload and display functionality

The fix has been applied successfully in the local development environment.

# Additional Deployment Fixes

## 1. Missing `nl2br` Jinja Filter

**Issue:** The template at `app/templates/projects/detail.html` is using a filter called `nl2br` to convert newlines to HTML breaks, but this filter hasn't been defined in the application. This results in the following error:

```
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateRuntimeError: Filter with name 'nl2br' not found.
```

**Implementation:**

1. Created a new utility module for template filters:
   - Created `app/utils/template_filters.py` with the `nl2br` filter implementation
   - Updated `app/app.py` to register the filter

```python
# In app/utils/template_filters.py
from flask import Markup

def register_template_filters(app):
    """Register custom template filters with the Flask application."""
    
    @app.template_filter('nl2br')
    def nl2br_filter(s):
        """Convert newlines in a string to HTML <br> tags."""
        if s is None:
            return ""
        return Markup(s.replace('\n', '<br>'))
```

```python
# In app/app.py (create_app function)
# Register custom template filters
from app.utils.template_filters import register_template_filters
register_template_filters(app)
```

2. Added a debug route for applying the fix without a full redeployment:
   - Created a new route at `/debug/fix-templates` that adds the filter at runtime
   - This can be used to quickly fix the issue in the production environment

```python
@debug_bp.route('/fix-templates', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def fix_templates():
    """Apply quick fixes to the template environment"""
    # Security check code omitted...
    
    # Add the nl2br filter to the template environment
    @current_app.template_filter('nl2br')
    def nl2br_filter(s):
        if s is None:
            return ""
        return Markup(s.replace('\n', '<br>'))
    
    return jsonify({
        'success': True,
        'message': 'Template fixes applied successfully',
        'fixes': ['nl2br filter added']
    })
```

## 2. Alternative Quick Fix for Template

As an alternative quick fix, modify the template to properly handle newlines without requiring a custom filter:

In `app/templates/projects/detail.html`, replace:
```html
<p>{{ project.description|nl2br }}</p>
```

with:
```html
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">{{ project.description }}</p>
```

And similarly for line 213:
```html
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">{{ project.request.task_description }}</p>
```

This uses CSS to preserve newlines without requiring a custom filter.

## 3. Other Log Observations

### Database Connection Issues
The deployment logs show several database connection errors like:
```
sqlalchemy.pool.impl.QueuePool - ERROR - Closing connection exception <object pg8000.legacy.Connection at 0x7726c14a5940>
...
pg8000.exceptions.InterfaceError: network error
```

These appear to be normal connection pool timeouts or connection resets in a cloud environment. The application is correctly handling these by establishing new connections as needed. No action is required for this.

### PostgreSQL Schema Configuration
The database schema setup appears to be working correctly:
```
app.models.database - INFO - Set search_path to rozoom_clients,rozoom_shop,rozoom_schema for connection 131008335337792
```

### Category Image Serving
The database-backed image storage solution for category images is functioning as expected:
```
10.201.209.196 - - [01/Сен/2025:17:26:55 +0000] "GET /category_media/category-image/1 HTTP/1.1" 200 1773935
```

## Recommendations

1. **Apply the nl2br Filter Fix**: Deploy the changes to add the template filter properly through the utils module.

2. **Temporary Fix**: If needed before a full deployment, access the `/debug/fix-templates` route to apply the fix at runtime.

3. **Monitor Database Pool**: Keep an eye on database connection errors. If they increase in frequency, consider:
   - Adjusting the connection pool settings
   - Setting a higher timeout value
   - Implementing a connection health check

4. **Image Size Optimization**: The category image being served (1.7MB) is quite large. Consider implementing image compression before storing in the database to reduce storage requirements and improve load times.

5. **Database Connection Pooling**: Consider using a more robust connection pooling solution or implementing a reconnection strategy to handle transient database connection issues more gracefully.

These fixes should resolve the main deployment issues identified in the logs.
