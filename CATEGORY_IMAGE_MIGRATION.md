Documentation for the Category Image Database Migration

This file outlines the steps required to migrate category images from the filesystem to the database
to prevent image loss when deploying to platforms with ephemeral storage like Render.com's free tier.

Files created or modified:

1. app/routes/category_media.py - Serves category images from the database
2. app/routes/media_routes.py - Registers the media blueprint with the Flask application
3. app/models/category_image_patch.py - Documentation of fields to add to the Category model 
4. app/utils/image_utils.py - Utilities for handling category image upload and storage
5. migrate_category_images.py - Script to migrate existing category images to the database
6. test_category_fields.py - Tool to test that the Category model has the new fields

Steps to implement:

1. First, modify the Category model in app/models/product.py:
   - Add image_data field (LargeBinary)
   - Add image_content_type field (String)  
   - Add image_filename field (String)

   Example:
   ```python
   # Add these fields to the Category model
   image_data = db.Column(db.LargeBinary)
   image_content_type = db.Column(db.String(100))
   image_filename = db.Column(db.String(255))
   ```

2. Run test_category_fields.py to verify the model changes:
   ```
   python test_category_fields.py
   ```

3. Migrate the database to add these columns:
   - If using Flask-Migrate, create and run a migration
   - Otherwise, the migrate_category_images.py script attempts to add the columns directly

4. Run the migration script:
   ```
   python migrate_category_images.py
   ```

5. Test that category images are correctly served:
   - Log into admin and edit/create a category with an image
   - Verify the image URL points to the new media route (/media/category-image/...)
   - Verify the image displays correctly on the frontend

Notes:
- The image URL format changes from /static/uploads/categories/... to /media/category-image/[category_id]
- Existing image URLs in the database will be updated during migration
- No changes to the frontend templates are needed as they use the URL stored in Category.image
